     <h3>i was kinda wanting to continue on with the exploration of the emotion of nostalgia, but his whole website making thing opns up so many more avenues that i could use. im also still pretty interested in the purposefully poor image aswell,<br> so i might just base the whole website on those, could be a true mindboggle<br> also in saying this, did you catch onto the title of the website? i thouhg it was semi-creative, or was it just a happy accident?, you will never know. Ok so its been a about a week since we started but ive kinda found my theme as such. my first year class helped with this, im wanting to go pre y2k and go full fairy mode. my late nan used to read me her old fairy books and although i cherish every moment of that, some of those fairies gave me madddd heebie jeebies.
